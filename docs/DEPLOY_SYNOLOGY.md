# Deploying Photo Platform on a Synology NAS

A complete, start-to-finish walkthrough: getting the app running in Container
Manager, and — the part that trips people up most — connecting a real domain
name to it with HTTPS. If you just want the short version, see the
[README](../README.md#deploying-on-a-synology-nas-dsm-72-container-manager);
this document goes deeper on every step, especially domains.

**Tested target**: DS920+ (x86-64), DSM 7.2. Anything DSM 7.2+ that can run
Container Manager (formerly Docker) should work the same way. ARM-based
models (e.g. DS220j) are not supported — Node.js/sharp need x86-64 or a
compatible ARM64 build, and this hasn't been tested on one.

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Synology NAS running **DSM 7.2 or later**, with the **Container Manager**
  package installed (Package Center → search "Container Manager" → Install).
- At least ~2 GB of free RAM during the first build (the build step compiles
  the Next.js app). 4 GB+ total NAS RAM is comfortable; on smaller models see
  the "build on a PC instead" note in [step 4](#4-build-and-run-in-container-manager).
- Admin access to DSM (Control Panel).
- Optional but recommended for the domain section: a domain name you own
  (from any registrar — Namecheap, Cloudflare, GoDaddy, etc.) or a free
  Synology QuickConnect/DDNS hostname. Both are covered below.
- Admin access to your home/office router, **if** your NAS is behind one and
  you want a custom domain (needed for port forwarding).

---

## 2. Get the code onto the NAS

Pick one:

**Option A — File Station (no SSH needed)**

1. Download this repository as a ZIP (GitHub → **Code** → **Download ZIP**)
   and unzip it on your computer.
2. In DSM **File Station**, create a folder, e.g. `docker/photo-platform`
   (i.e. `/volume1/docker/photo-platform`).
3. Upload the project folder's contents there. You do **not** need to upload
   `node_modules`, `.next`, or `data` if present locally — they're not part
   of the repo and are ignored by the Docker build either way.

**Option B — git clone over SSH** (if you're comfortable with a terminal)

1. Enable SSH: **Control Panel → Terminal & SNMP → Enable SSH service**.
2. SSH into the NAS: `ssh your-user@<nas-ip> -p 22`.
3. `cd /volume1/docker && git clone https://github.com/<your-fork-or-repo>.git photo-platform`

Either way you should end up with a folder containing `Dockerfile`,
`docker-compose.yml`, `package.json`, `prisma/`, `src/`, etc.

---

## 3. Configure the environment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in that same folder (File Station:
   right-click `.env.example` → Copy, then rename the copy to `.env`; or over
   SSH: `cp .env.example .env`).
2. Edit `.env` (File Station → right-click `.env` → **Open with Text
   Editor**, or `vi .env` over SSH) and fill in every value:

| Variable | What to set |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Leave as-is: `file:/data/db/app.db?connection_limit=1` |
| `PHOTOS_DIR` | Leave as-is: `/data/photos` |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Your admin login name |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | A long, unique password — stored only as a bcrypt hash, never in plaintext |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | 32+ random characters — see below |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Your public HTTPS address, e.g. `https://photos.example.com`. Used to build shareable booking links, so it must match whatever domain you land on in [step 6](#6-connect-a-domain) |
| `STRIP_ORIGINAL_EXIF` | `false` keeps uploaded originals untouched on disk; `true` re-encodes uploads so even the stored original has no EXIF/GPS (displayed images always have EXIF stripped either way) |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_MB` | Max size per uploaded photo, default `100` |

To generate a good `SESSION_SECRET`:

- Over SSH: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- No SSH access: use any password generator for a 32+ character random
  string, or run `openssl rand -base64 32` on your own computer (macOS/Linux
  have it built in; on Windows use Git Bash or WSL).

> **Don't leave `APP_BASE_URL` as `http://localhost:...` or the NAS's bare
> IP.** Booking confirmation links and visitor cancel-links are built from
> this value — if it's wrong, links you share with clients will be broken.
> It's fine to start with `http://<nas-ip>:3000` while testing locally on
> your own network, but switch it to the real HTTPS domain before sharing
> any links externally (see [step 6](#6-connect-a-domain)).

---

## 4. Build and run in Container Manager

1. Open **Container Manager → Project → Create**.
2. **Project name**: `photo-platform`.
   **Path**: the folder from step 2 (e.g. `/volume1/docker/photo-platform`).
   Container Manager will auto-detect `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Click through the wizard and **Build**. The first build downloads the
   Node.js base images and compiles the app — expect **5–15 minutes** on a
   DS920+. Subsequent rebuilds (after updates) are faster since most layers
   are cached.
4. Once running, the app listens on **port 3000** inside the container, which
   `docker-compose.yml` maps to port **3000** on the NAS too. The
   `data/photos` and `data/db` folders (created automatically next to the
   compose file) are your persistent volumes — the container itself can be
   destroyed and recreated freely without losing data.

**If the build fails, or the NAS struggles (low RAM, build gets killed):**
build the image on a regular PC with Docker installed instead, then import
it:

```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t photo-platform:latest .
docker save photo-platform:latest -o photo-platform.tar
```

Copy `photo-platform.tar` to the NAS, then in Container Manager: **Image →
Add → From file**, select the tar. Then edit `docker-compose.yml` to replace
`build: .` with `image: photo-platform:latest`, and create the project as in
step 1 above (it will use the imported image instead of building).

---

## 5. First run

1. Visit `http://<nas-ip>:3000/en/admin/login` (or `/zh/admin/login` for
   Chinese) from a browser on your local network.
2. Log in with the `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in `.env` —
   this first successful login is what creates the admin account in the
   database. After that, changing `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` has no further
   effect (the database copy is what's checked from then on).
3. You'll land in the first-run **setup wizard** — follow it to pick which
   features you want (booking, lottery, credit-profile management) and set
   basic branding. You can change all of this later from **Admin →
   Settings**.
4. Create a gallery event, upload some photos, and publish it. If booking is
   enabled, create a booking event with time slots and try the public
   booking flow end-to-end.

At this point the site works over plain HTTP on your local network. The next
section covers making it reachable — securely — from the internet under your
own domain.

---

## 6. Connect a domain

This is the section people usually get stuck on, so it's split into every
piece separately. The end state: visiting `https://your-domain.com` from
anywhere on the internet shows your site, with a valid padlock, while DSM
itself (and every other NAS service) stays exactly as private as before.

**How it fits together**: your domain's DNS record points at your NAS's
public IP address (directly, or indirectly via a DDNS hostname) → your
router forwards ports 80/443 to the NAS → DSM's reverse proxy takes HTTPS
traffic for that domain and forwards it internally to the app's port 3000 →
DSM also handles getting and renewing the HTTPS certificate. The app
container itself never talks to the internet directly or knows anything
about domains beyond the `APP_BASE_URL` value you give it.

### 6.1 Do you have a static public IP?

Most home/small-business internet connections have a **dynamic** IP (it can
change). Check what your ISP gives you — if you're not sure, assume dynamic.
This decides which of the two paths below you need.

- **Dynamic IP** (most people): you need a DDNS (dynamic DNS) hostname that
  auto-updates when your IP changes. Do [6.2](#62-set-up-ddns-required-for-dynamic-ips) first.
- **Static IP**: you can point your domain straight at it and skip DDNS
  entirely — go to [6.3](#63-point-your-domain-at-the-nas).

### 6.2 Set up DDNS (required for dynamic IPs)

1. **Control Panel → External Access → DDNS → Add**.
2. Easiest option: choose **Synology** as the service, sign in with (or
   create) a free Synology account, and pick a hostname like
   `yourname.synology.me`. DSM keeps this updated automatically whenever your
   public IP changes — no further setup needed.
3. If you'd rather not use a Synology account, other providers (No-IP,
   DynDNS, etc.) work the same way — pick one from the dropdown and follow
   its instructions.
4. Test it: after a minute or two, `yourname.synology.me` should resolve to
   your current public IP. (`nslookup yourname.synology.me` from any
   computer, or just visit it in a browser once port forwarding in
   [6.4](#64-forward-ports-80443-on-your-router) is done.)

If you're happy with a `*.synology.me` address, you can stop here and use it
as your domain in the rest of this guide (skip straight to
[6.4](#64-forward-ports-80443-on-your-router)). If you want your **own**
custom domain (e.g. `photos.yourstudio.com`), continue to 6.3.

### 6.3 Point your domain at the NAS

Log into your domain registrar's DNS management page (or Cloudflare, if you
use it as your DNS provider) and add one record:

- **Static IP**: an **A record** — Name: `photos` (or `@` for the bare
  domain), Type: `A`, Value: your public IP address.
- **Dynamic IP (using DDNS from 6.2)**: a **CNAME record** instead — Name:
  `photos`, Type: `CNAME`, Value: `yourname.synology.me` (your DDNS
  hostname). This way the domain always points at whatever your current IP
  is, via the DDNS hostname, without you touching DNS again.

Either way this gives you something like `photos.yourstudio.com`. DNS
changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to propagate —
if it doesn't resolve immediately, wait and try again before assuming
something's wrong.

> If you use Cloudflare's orange-cloud proxy on the record, turn it **off**
> (grey cloud, "DNS only") for the initial setup — DSM's Let's Encrypt
> validation and the reverse proxy work more predictably against the NAS's
> real IP. You can revisit Cloudflare's proxy/CDN features later once
> everything works.

### 6.4 Forward ports 80/443 on your router

DSM needs to receive traffic on ports 80 (for the one-time Let's Encrypt
domain check) and 443 (HTTPS) from the internet.

1. Find your NAS's **local** IP address: **Control Panel → Network → Network
   Interface**.
2. Log into your router's admin page (commonly `192.168.1.1` or
   `192.168.0.1` — check the sticker on the router if unsure) and find **Port
   Forwarding** (sometimes called **Virtual Server** or **NAT**).
3. Add two rules forwarding external ports **80** and **443** to the NAS's
   local IP, same ports (80→80, 443→443). Leave port 3000 out of this — it
   should **not** be exposed directly to the internet; only DSM's reverse
   proxy (443) will be public-facing.
4. Some routers have "hardware NAT" or "SIP ALG" options that occasionally
   interfere with port forwarding — leave them at their defaults unless you
   hit problems, then try toggling them.

**CGNAT check**: if your ISP shows you a public IP in your router's status
page, but that IP doesn't match what `https://whatismyip.com` shows from a
device on that network, you're likely behind **Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)** —
port forwarding won't work because you don't actually have a dedicated
public IP. Contact your ISP about a static/dedicated IP option, or use a
tunnel-based alternative like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale Funnel instead
of direct port forwarding (out of scope for this guide, but both integrate
fine with DSM's reverse proxy as the final hop).

### 6.5 Get an HTTPS certificate

1. **Control Panel → Security → Certificate → Add → Add a new certificate →
   Get a certificate from Let's Encrypt**.
2. Enter your domain name (e.g. `photos.yourstudio.com`) and an email for
   renewal notices. Leave "Subject Alternative Name" empty unless you also
   want `www.` — if so, add `www.photos.yourstudio.com` there too (and a
   matching DNS record).
3. DSM validates domain ownership over port 80 (which is why step 6.4 has to
   be done first) and issues the certificate. This normally takes under a
   minute if DNS and port forwarding are correct.
4. Certificates from Let's Encrypt auto-renew via DSM roughly every 60 days —
   nothing further to do here.

### 6.6 Set up the reverse proxy

This is the piece that maps `https://photos.yourstudio.com` (public, port
443) to the app container (internal, port 3000).

1. **Control Panel → Login Portal → Advanced → Reverse Proxy → Create**.
2. **Source**:
   - Protocol: `HTTPS`
   - Hostname: `photos.yourstudio.com` (your domain from 6.3, or the DDNS
     hostname from 6.2 if you're using that directly)
   - Port: `443`
3. **Destination**:
   - Protocol: `HTTP`
   - Hostname: `localhost`
   - Port: `3000`
4. Leave the custom header / WebSocket options at their defaults — this app
   doesn't need WebSocket passthrough.
5. Save. Make sure the certificate from 6.5 is assigned to this hostname:
   **Control Panel → Security → Certificate → Settings**, and confirm
   `photos.yourstudio.com` is mapped to the Let's Encrypt certificate (DSM
   usually does this automatically if it's the only certificate for that
   domain).

### 6.7 Point the app at its real address

1. Edit `.env` and set `APP_BASE_URL="https://photos.yourstudio.com"` (your
   actual domain, matching exactly what you configured above — same scheme,
   no trailing slash).
2. In Container Manager, select the `photo-platform` project → **Action →
   Build/Recreate** so the container picks up the new environment variable.
   (This just recreates the container with the new `.env` values — your data
   in `data/photos` and `data/db` is untouched.)

### 6.8 Test it

From a device **outside** your home network (e.g. mobile data with Wi-Fi
off) visit `https://photos.yourstudio.com`. You should see the site with a
valid padlock. Check a few things:

- The homepage loads and images render.
- **Admin → Settings** saves changes without errors.
- If booking is enabled, create a test booking and confirm the link you'd
  share (visible on the confirmation page) uses `https://photos.yourstudio.com/...`,
  not `localhost` or the bare NAS IP — if it doesn't, double-check
  `APP_BASE_URL` and that you rebuilt the container after changing it.
- `http://<nas-ip>:3000` should still work from your local network too
  (useful for troubleshooting), but don't share that link externally — it's
  unencrypted and bypasses the reverse proxy.

---

## 7. Backups

Everything that matters lives in two folders next to the compose file:

- `data/photos` — originals + generated web sizes (thumb/med/full) for every
  photo, plus site images (logo, background, contact QR code).
- `data/db` — the SQLite database: events, captions, bookings, settings,
  everything else.

Use **Hyper Backup** to back both up on a schedule — nightly is plenty for a
personal/small-studio site. The database is a single file; a backup taken
while someone is actively uploading photos or making a booking could in
theory catch it mid-write, so either schedule backups for a quiet time (e.g.
4 am) or stop the Container Manager project first for a guaranteed
consistent snapshot. Restoring is just putting both folders back and
starting the project again.

---

## 8. Updating the app

1. Replace the project files with the new version — **keep `.env` and
   `data/`**, don't overwrite or delete either.
   - File Station: upload the new files over the old ones (skip `.env` and
     `data/` in the upload).
   - Git: `git pull` inside the project folder over SSH.
2. In Container Manager: project → **Action → Build/Recreate**.
3. Database migrations run automatically at container startup (see
   `docker-entrypoint.sh`) — no manual migration step needed.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

**Build fails or hangs on the NAS.** Usually low RAM. Build on a PC instead
and import the image — see the note at the end of [step 4](#4-build-and-run-in-container-manager).

**Container Manager shows the project running, but `http://<nas-ip>:3000`
doesn't load.** Check the container's logs (Container Manager → Container →
select it → **Details → Log**) for a crash on startup — most often a missing
or malformed `.env` value. Confirm `.env` exists in the project folder (not
just `.env.example`) and every variable from [step 3](#3-configure-the-environment)
is filled in.

**`https://your-domain` shows a DSM error page or "502 Bad Gateway".** The
reverse proxy is reachable but can't reach the app. Confirm the container is
actually running, and that the reverse proxy's destination port (6.6) is
`3000` — the same port `docker-compose.yml` publishes.

**`https://your-domain` doesn't load at all (times out).** Almost always
port forwarding ([6.4](#64-forward-ports-80443-on-your-router)) or CGNAT.
Confirm DNS resolves to the right IP first (`nslookup your-domain`), then
confirm ports 80/443 are actually forwarded (many routers have a "port
forwarding test" tool, or use an external site like
[canyouseeme.org](https://canyouseeme.org) to check from outside your
network).

**Certificate request fails.** DSM couldn't validate domain ownership over
port 80 — almost always a port-forwarding or DNS issue. Fix
[6.3](#63-point-your-domain-at-the-nas) and [6.4](#64-forward-ports-80443-on-your-router)
first, then retry the certificate.

**Booking/cancel links point at the wrong address.** `APP_BASE_URL` in
`.env` is wrong, or the container wasn't rebuilt after changing it — see
[6.7](#67-point-the-app-at-its-real-address).

**Forgot the admin password.** Stop the project, delete `data/db/app.db`,
update `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`, start the project again, and log in once
to reseed the account. **This wipes all events, bookings, and settings** —
only do this on a fresh install, or restore from a backup instead if you
have real data.

---

## 10. Security checklist

- Never expose port **3000** directly to the internet (no port-forwarding
  rule for it) — only DSM's reverse proxy on 443 should be public. The
  app has no HTTPS of its own; DSM is what makes this safe.
- Use a long, unique `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and a random 32+ character
  `SESSION_SECRET` — both are described in [step 3](#3-configure-the-environment).
- Keep DSM itself updated (**Control Panel → Update & Restore**) and enable
  2-factor authentication for your DSM login — a compromised DSM account is a
  bigger risk than anything in this app.
- Login attempts to `/admin/login` are rate-limited (10 attempts / 15 min per
  IP) and the admin password is bcrypt-hashed — but this is in-memory rate
  limiting that resets on container restart, not a substitute for a strong
  password.
- Back up regularly (see [step 7](#7-backups)) — it's the only real
  protection against disk failure, accidental deletion, or a botched update.
